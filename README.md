# Autonomous World Hackathon - Dragons and Rollies

Repo for Dragons and Rollies Augmented Reality Game.

## Project Description

Dragons and Rollies the 1st multiplatform game of many that can be played both in 2D and Augmented Reality. Dragon vs Rollies is Tic Tac Toe where the X is the dragonfly and O Rolly Polly. Users pick a team (Water Earth Fire Air) and are able to create, join, or spectate multilpe games with friends. Winners are able to claim collectibles and earn prestige for their team with a daily leaderboard for teams.

## Features

We're focused on showcasing eh potential of multiplatform games on chain especially with Augmented Reality via the browser. Creating a fully deecentralized experience and ownership of the game. Our goal with the 1st set of features is to show the full flow of experience from joining your team, playing and winning a game earning prestige for your team and a collectible to share with friends and family.

- Join team and mint team collectible
- Play Tic Tac Toe in 2D or Augmented Reality format
- Spectate other games being played in 2D
- Earn Collectible for team if winner
- Share Win on Socials and encourage friends to join team.

## How it Works

## What's next?

Mud opens up the spatial world and the ability to create experiences that can happen in the physical world autonmously. There's so much potential to create a whole ecosystem of games full decentralized from back to frontend that can be augmented as the tech develops especially in the ZK and AI space. The real utility comes from the ability to create experience that not only take place in the physical world but also allow use to learn and share our knowledge, such as on image identification of plants with ZK-ML that can be used in a educational setting for a scavenger hunt where you compete to find the most plants.

- Expand game selection (Uno, Checkers, Marvel Snap).
- Tie perks to collectibles and enable more utility within team and external world.
- Add in more AI driven features to power dynamic creature generation.
- Add Pokemon esque deck functionality so users can use their own creatures in game
- Add ZK to enable more location based features for gameplay

3. Install foundry via foundryup using Git bash

### Starting

To start the project run: `pnpm run dev`

You should see this if all things went well
![Dev Terminal for MUD development](https://v2.mud.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fquick-start-mud-cli.f66792ef.png&w=1200&q=75)

After deployment is successful, pop over to the web client which if port `3000` is open it is using (localhost)(http://localhost:3000/) and checkout your live app. When you visit you’ll see an increment button and dev tools open in the right-hand panel. Try clicking the button and seeing what updates in the dev tools!
